# Smart Survey

This survey application is designed to seamlessly collect and process user responses using Google Sheets. The app prompts participants to enter their full name and respond to a series of questions with 'yes' or 'no' answers. It ensures data integrity by validating the format of the entered names and responses, allowing only properly formatted names and valid answers. The survey includes diverse questions ranging from personal experiences to beliefs, making it a versatile tool for gathering a wide array of information.

Once the data is collected, the application updates a Google Sheets worksheet with the new responses. It then calculates and displays the percentage of participants who answered similarly to the current respondent for each question, providing immediate feedback on how their answers compare with those of others. This functionality not only facilitates data collection but also offers valuable insights into common trends and opinions among the survey participants.
